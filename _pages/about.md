## About myself
Hey everyone. My name is _Borys Rudenko_. I am passionate software developer living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
I am working in IT industry for more than 10 years and I spend my days in many different areas of software development, like designing various banking/enterprise solutions, technical staff leading, writing code, etc.


My philosophy on learning and using new technologies is always the same: don't be scary, experiment, write pet projects, fail, fix, fail again, fix again.
Reading a lot of books and all possible materials before you start in order to be prepared to everything will not give you a good result. You should find a learning/coding balance here. Practice without theory is blind. Theory without practice is dead.


You also can check my resume in details in my [LinkedIn][LinkedIn] profile.

## About this blog
In this blog I am going to share my experience about different technologies, agile processes and everything which every developer is normally facing during his work.

In the ***Blog*** section you can find different articles about different topics. Normally I am trying to keep them short and in same time as much informative as possible.

In the ***Workshop*** part of this blog I'll place practical information together with application skeletons and exercises.
